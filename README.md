## Company Background:
 AtliQ Hardware is the fastest-growing company in the electronics market, with global expansion. They manufacture computer hardware and other accessories. However, when they expanded their business into Latin America, they faced significant losses due to decisions based on intuition and incomplete data. Previously, AtliQ relied on Excel for analysis, but as the company grew, Excel became insufficient for their data needs. As a result, they needed a data analytics team to bring transparency to their data and help them make more accurate and informed decisions.
